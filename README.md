# üíº Talent Flow ‚Äî Next.js Application

This is a **Hiring Web Platform** built with **Next.js**.  
It uses **MirageJS** to simulate backend APIs, **IndexedDB** (via Dexie) for local data storage, and a modern UI powered by **TailwindCSS** and **Lucide React Icons**.

## üöÄ Setup

Follow the steps below to run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### 3. Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

### 4. Open the app
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

üëâ [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üß± Architecture

The architecture of the **Talent Flow** Next.js app is designed to be clean, modular, and easily extensible.

- **Frontend Framework:** Built on **Next.js**, leveraging its file-based routing and React component-based architecture.  
- **Styling:** Uses **TailwindCSS** for responsive and utility-first design.  
- **Mock Backend:**  
  - **MirageJS** is used to mock a real server environment.
  - It seeds **user** and **job** data from JSON files into an in-memory database.
  - These data are exposed through various REST-like API routes.
- **State Management:** The **Context API** is used throughout the app for shared global state handling.
- **Icons & Notifications:**  
  - **Lucide React Icons** for clean, lightweight icons.  
  - **React Toastify** for elegant toast notifications.
- **Storage Layer:**  
  - Uses **IndexedDB** to store data directly in the browser.
  - **Dexie.js** acts as a convenient wrapper to handle database operations.
- **Routing & Structure:**  
  - Next.js **file-based routing** is employed to define pages.
  - Major logical API routes include:
    - `/jobs`
    - `/candidates`
    - `/assessments`
    - `/responses`
    - `/notes`
    - `/login` and `/signup`
  - Each route handles its own responsibilities, mirroring typical backend endpoints.

## ü™≤ Issues

### 1. MirageJS and Next.js Routing Conflict
The first issue encountered was during the integration of **Next.js** with **MirageJS**.  
MirageJS overrides the browser‚Äôs native `window.fetch` function, while Next.js‚Äô file-based routing also relies on it internally.  
This led to conflicts between the two systems.

**Fix:**  
A temporary solution was implemented ‚Äî whenever the route changes, the MirageJS server is turned **off** and then turned **back on**.  
This resolves the fetch conflict but introduces a side effect:  
> The MirageJS server seeds data multiple times if the user navigates frequently within the app.

### 2. Assessment Builder Performance
Another issue lies in the **Assessment Builder component**.  
As users add more questions, the **complex state updates** cause noticeable slowdowns and performance degradation in the browser.  
This could be optimized in the future using **memoization**, **React batching**, or restructuring the state logic.

---

### 3. Minor State Management Issues
There are a few minor inconsistencies in state synchronization between components due to the extensive use of the **Context API**.  
These are non-breaking but may cause minor UI delays or stale renders in rare cases.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Decisions

This section explains the rationale behind the chosen technologies and design patterns.

- **Next.js:**  
  Chosen because it is a powerful framework built on top of React, offering **file-based routing**, **server-side rendering**, and built-in integration with **TailwindCSS** without needing separate configurations. It simplifies project setup while maintaining scalability.

- **Dexie.js:**  
  Used for managing **IndexedDB** easily. Instead of manually writing verbose IndexedDB operations, Dexie provides a clean and intuitive API for performing CRUD operations efficiently.

- **TailwindCSS:**  
  Enables inline, utility-first styling ‚Äî allowing rapid UI design without constantly switching between CSS files. It makes components concise and easier to maintain.

- **Context API:**  
  Preferred over **Redux** for simplicity. While Redux is powerful, it can be verbose and overkill for small to mid-sized applications. Context API offers lightweight state management that‚Äôs easy to set up and reason about.

- **Client-Side Filtering & Searching:**  
  For job listings and candidate data, **client-side searching and filtering** were implemented instead of backend queries.  
  The idea is simple ‚Äî data is fetched once, and then React‚Äôs **useEffect** hooks handle local filtering, searching, and pagination directly in the browser.

- **Assessment Component Timer:**  
  During an assessment, a **timer** runs for a specified duration and automatically **submits** the user‚Äôs response when the timer reaches zero.  
  This feature ensures fair evaluation and enforces time limits without requiring a backend timer system.
